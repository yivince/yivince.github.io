Hi! I am a Lecturer in the Civil Engineering (CE) Department at the Zhengzhou University of Aeronautics, China. I received my Ph.D. degree from [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/) advised by Professor [Xianfeng LIU]([https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xianfeng-Liu-4]). Prior to that, I received my MS in geotechnical engineering from TYUT, where I was co-supervised by Prof. [David Du](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-du-47b79719/) and Prof. [Xiaohong Bai](http://jgxy.tyut.edu.cn/info/1286/3320.htm). I have a BS in [CE](https://tmxy.csuft.edu.cn/) from [CSUFT](https://english.csuft.edu.cn/), where I worked in [Hongbin Xiao](https://tmxy.csuft.edu.cn/szdw/jsfc/201006/t20100607_33824.html)'s lab.
