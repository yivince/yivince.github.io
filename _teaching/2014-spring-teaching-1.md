[Soil mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_mechanics) is a branch of soil physics and applied mechanics that describes the behavior of soils. It differs from fluid mechanics and solid mechanics in the sense that soils consist of a heterogeneous mixture of fluids (usually air and water) and particles.
